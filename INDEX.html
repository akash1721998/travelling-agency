    <h3 >Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.[1] Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.</h3>

    <h1>BEACH</h1>
    <p>Even in Roman times, wealthy people spent their free time on the coast. They also built large villa complexes with bathing facilities (so-called maritime villas) in particularly beautiful locations.The development of the beach as a popular leisure resort from the mid-19th century was the first manifestation of what is now the global tourist industry. The first seaside resorts were opened in the 18th century for the aristocracy, who began to frequent the seaside as well as the then fashionable spa towns, for recreation and health.[9] One of the earliest such seaside resorts, was Scarborough in Yorkshire during the 1720s;</p>

    <h1>RED FORT</h1>
    <p>The Red Fort Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad - the new capital of the fifth Mughal Emperor of India, Shah Jahan. Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to an older fort, the Salimgarh, built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546, with which it forms the Red Fort Complex.
        Built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as the palace fort of his capital Shahjahanabad, the Red Fort is famous for its massive enclosing walls. The fort's construction was completed over a span of ten years, between 1638 and 1648.

    <h1>TAJ</h1>
    <p>It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD.The Taj Mahal celebrates the great love of India's Mughal ruler Shah Jahan for his beloved wife Arjumand Banu Begum, better known to history as Mumtaz Mahal or “jewel of the palace.” Jahan first spotted Mumtaz in the bazaar at Agra, selling silks and beads, and the young prince fell madly in love at first sight with .What is the history of the name Taj?
        Taj is a quirky boy's name of Sanskrit, Arabic, and Hindi origins, meaning “crown.” This short but gorgeous name shares all of the prestige of the seventeenth-century Taj Mahal. A jewel of Muslim art, the Indian palace was built to memorialize the wife of an emperor, and serves as an eternal etymology for baby Taj..</p>

    <h1>WILD LIFE</h1>
    <p>Stone Age people and hunter-gatherers relied on wildlife, both plants and animals, for their food. In fact, some species may have been hunted to extinction by early human hunters. Today, hunting, fishing, and gathering wildlife is still a significant food source in some parts of the world.Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.[1] Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, plains, grasslands, woodlands, forests, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.</p>
